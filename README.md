# üìÑ SRS Generator from Code (Groq LLaMA 3)

This is a simple yet powerful web application built with Streamlit that generates a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document based on code files using Groq's **LLaMA 3** model. The tool supports various programming languages and formats, and it can generate an SRS document that is useful for companies and software development teams.

## Features

- **Code Upload**: Upload your code files and let the app generate an SRS document based on the code.
- **Multiple File Format Support**: Supports Python (.py), JavaScript (.js), HTML (.html), Java (.java), C++ (.cpp), and Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb).
- **Explanation of Code**: For a deeper understanding, click **"üîç Explain Code"** to get a detailed breakdown of the code's functionality.
- **SRS Preview**: After generating the SRS, a preview of the document will be displayed in the app.
- **Download**: You can download the generated SRS document in PDF format by clicking on the **"üì• Download SRS PDF"** button.
